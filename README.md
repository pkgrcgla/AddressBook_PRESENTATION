## AddressBook .NET Core MVC Project

### Overview

This project, developed during the edu4tech .Net Core Bootcamp, is a comprehensive AddressBook application implemented using Visual Studio .Net 6 ASP.NET MVC CORE. It adheres to the Entity Framework Core Code-First approach and features a flexible and modular architecture with distinct layers.

### Features

- Dynamic Population: The application reads provinces and districts from an Excel file on the back-end during the initial launch and adds them to the database.
  
- Membership System: Utilizes AspnetCore Identity to create a robust membership system.

- AJAX Operations: The AddressBook includes an intuitive user interface with AJAX operations. For instance, selecting a province instantly displays its districts, and the same applies to districts and neighborhoods.

- API Integration: Mahalle (neighborhood) postal codes are fetched from the API: https://api.ubilisim.com/postakodu/il/34.
